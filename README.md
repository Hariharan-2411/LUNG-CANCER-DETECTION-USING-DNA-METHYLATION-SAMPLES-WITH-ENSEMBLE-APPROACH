# LUNG-CANCER-DETECTION-USING-DNA-METHYLATION-SAMPLES-WITH-ENSEMBLE-APPROACH

This project applies the GCForest (Deep Forest) machine learning algorithm to three areas of medical data analysis:

- **Classification**: General categorization based on input features
- **Diagnosis**: Identifying medical conditions
- **Prognosis**: Predicting future medical outcomes

The GCForest model is implemented using Python and scikit-learn, and each section contains its own script for running the model on different datasets.

This project was developed for academic purposes to explore ensemble-based deep learning approaches in healthcare analytics.
